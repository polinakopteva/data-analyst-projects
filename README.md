# data-analyst-projects

The following projects are designed to develop the skills and abilities of a data analyst. When combined with other projects, they form a portfolio of various approaches to data collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization.

| Name of project | Description of project | Skills and tools | 
| ------------- |:-------------|:-----:|
| [Anomaly detection](Anomaly detection) | The goal of the project is to identify unusual patterns or outliers in the data that deviate from expected behavior using multivariate anomaly detection techniques - Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor, Histogram-based Outlier Detection, Isolation Forest and K-Nearest Neighbours. | *python*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *sklearn*, *pyod* |
| [Customer segmentation](Customer segmentation) | This project aims to classify customers using the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) technique. The main goal of the project is to create a model that predicts purchases made by a new customer in the next few years, starting from their first purchase. | *python*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *plotly*, *sklearn*, *scipy*, *yellowbrick* |
| [Market basket analysis](Market basket analysis) | In this study, we use transactional data from a retail store to analyze the items that are often purchased together. We use the apriori algorithm and association rules to identify these patterns. | *python*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *mlxtend* |
| [Time series forecast](Time series forecast) | The project is dedicated to predicting future values based on historical time series data - in this case, data from the OpenAQ API. | *python*, *pandas*, *geopandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn*, *plotly*, *requests*, *statsmodels*, *ARIMA* |
